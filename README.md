A sober dark syntax theme for Atom, part of Moth's [FONC YOU](https://germanponte.com/moth/foncyou/) collection.

See the socially-inept nerd at color school, bullied by the popular Base16 and Monokai kids. He jumped the fence for grayer pastures and has been on the League of Achromatic Merit ever since.

`Font: Inconsolata / UI: One Dark / CSS colors: highlight-colors by brumm (not part of the theme)`

Moth Mono proposes an alternative of subtle grayscale variations that fades out of the way and lets a Zen-like state of mind descend upon the coding guru. A theme to focus on essence.
